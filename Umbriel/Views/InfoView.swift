Your password strength is based on a points system with a higher point count equalling a stronger password. \n\nIf you cannot think of a strong enough password or just want one created for you, the password generator will do this for you. Customise this password by choosing its length between 8 and 40 characters and for it to include numbers and symbols which is highly recommended.\n\nUmbriel also comes with a secure vault where you can store your passwords where only you can access using your FaceID or TouchID sensors*. TheVault uses your devices built-in security technology to protect your stored passwords. All passwords are stored on your device with no external database used and uses iCloud to sync these passwords across your other devices.\n\n")
